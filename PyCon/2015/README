To reconstruct the tree, just run ./build

If you see any:

    warning: problem downloading item

... just run ./build again until you don't see any such warnings any more,
then your tree is complete.

If you do *not* see a:

    warning: bad feed content

... at the end, you have not exhausted the playlist. Increase the upper bound
on the loop expression.


The playlist ID for the channel was found using the Google API explorer.

The PyCon 2015 channel is UCgxzjK6GuOHVKR_08TT4hJQ, so you go get the channel metadata (push "Execute"):

https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.channels.list?part=contentDetails&id=UCgxzjK6GuOHVKR_08TT4hJQ

[ . . . ]
    "relatedPlaylists": {
     "uploads": "UUgxzjK6GuOHVKR_08TT4hJQ"
    },
[ . . . ]

.. and that's the playlist that goes into the URL in ./build.
